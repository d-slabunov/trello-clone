## What is this app about

It's a Trello like app that I made for my portfolio.

## What am I using to create the app

I'm using create-react-app for a client and node and express for server. Also, I'm using mongodb as a database and bootstrap as a css framework.

## What you can do using the app

Almost all things those you can do with original Trello:

# Boards:
 - create, edit and delete boards
 - switch between boards
 - add users those can see and edit board, cards and leave comments
 - make a board private or public
 - create, edit and delete columns with cards on a board

# Cards
 - create, edit and delete cards
 - leave comments to cards
 - drag cards to another column

# Accounting
 - sign up and log in with email (and log out of course)
 - editing profile: email, nick, credentials

# Chat
 - Also, I'm considering to add a chat to a board

# Configs

To check it out create .env file in "server" folder and set JWT_SECRET.
Also, in server/index.js set correct MONGODB_URI and PORT for process.env.

# P.S.

This is my first own app that I'm making all by myself. I hope it will be good enough to you consider to invite me to interview. I'm looking for trainee/junior position. But if you have something different (and still in front-end) and interesting, please, let me know!
